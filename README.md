# AutoWindowSize
A tool that allows you to set the screen resolution to a desired one upon opening an app

You can also use it as a startup app, imo its the best way to utilize this app

## How to run application at startup :
- For Windows: Press `Win+R` then type `shell:startup` and paste the file there
- idk about the rest of the OSes out there... sorry :(
